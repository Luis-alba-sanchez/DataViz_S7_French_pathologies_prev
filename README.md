This projet is made by Luis ALBA SANCHEZ, a bio-informatic student at EFREI Paris. The director of my major is Mano Mathiew.

The objectif of this project is to make an analysis from any dataset provided by the governement from this plateforme : www.data.gouv.fr
I have choosen this dataset : 
https://data.ameli.fr/explore/dataset/effectifs/download?format=csv&timezone=Europe/Berlin&use_labels_for_header=false

from this page :
https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/effectif-de-patients-par-pathologie-sexe-classe-dage-et-territoire-departement-region/

This dataset provide a lot of information about french pathologies, sexe, age et territory on time. I was simply curious to study these variations, see which insight i could find and publy my work on github to let anyone us my work.

This roject is a two part project. I am first doing on jupiter for convignent reason the Data cleaning and processing, The data exploration analysis (EDA) and some data visualisation. And I will finaly use streamlit on python to make a web interface that shows all this work.
